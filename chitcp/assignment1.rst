Assignment 1: TCP over a Reliable Network
=========================================

This part of the project is divided into three main tasks:

-  3-way handshake (20 points)
-  Data transfer (60 points)
-  Connection tear-down (20 points)

Implementing the TCP 3-way handshake
------------------------------------

In ``tcp.c`` you must implement the following:

-  Handling event ``APPLICATION_CONNECT`` in
   ``chitcpd_tcp_state_handle_CLOSED``. This corresponds to handling the
   ``OPEN Call`` in the ``CLOSED STATE`` in 
   `[RFC793 3.9] <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.9>`__.

-  Handling event ``PACKET_ARRIVAL`` in:

   -  ``chitcpd_tcp_state_handle_LISTEN``

   -  ``chitcpd_tcp_state_handle_SYN_SENT``

   -  ``chitcpd_tcp_state_handle_SYN_RCVD``

   As described in the ``SEGMENT ARRIVES`` portion of 
   `[RFC793 3.9] <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.9>`__.

Suggestion: Instead of writing separate pieces of code in each of the
handler functions where youâ€™re handling the ``PACKET_ARRIVAL`` event,
you may want to write a single function whose purpose is to handle
packets in any TCP state, following the general procedure described in
pages 64-75 of `[RFC793] <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793>`__. This
will also make it easier to implement Project 2b.

Sending and receiving data
--------------------------

This involves handling the following events in
``chitcpd_tcp_state_handle_ESTABLISHED``:

-  Event ``PACKET_ARRIVAL``, as described in the ``SEGMENT ARRIVES``
   portion of `[RFC793
   3.9] <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.9>`__, but
   without handling ``FIN`` packets.

-  Event ``APPLICATION_SEND``. This corresponds to handling the
   ``SEND Call`` in the ``ESTABLISHED STATE`` in 
   `[RFC793 3.9] <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.9>`__. Take into
   account that the chisocket layer already takes care of putting
   data in the send buffer. So, this event notifies your TCP
   implementation that there is new data in the send buffer, and that
   it should be sent if possible.

-  Event ``APPLICATION_RECEIVE``. This corresponds to handling the
   ``RECEIVE Call`` in the ``ESTABLISHED STATE`` in 
   `[RFC793 3.9] <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.9>`__. Take into
   account that the chisocket layer already takes care of retrieving
   data from the receive buffer and handing it to the application
   layer. This event notifies your TCP implementation that space has
   become available in the buffer, and you should update the TCP
   internal variables accordingly.


Connection tear-down
--------------------

This involves handling the ``APPLICATION_CLOSE`` event in the
following handlers:

-  ``chitcpd_tcp_state_handle_ESTABLISHED``

-  ``chitcpd_tcp_state_handle_CLOSE_WAIT``

Both of these correspond to handling the ``CLOSE Call`` in the
``ESTABLISHED STATE`` and ``CLOSE-WAIT STATE`` in 
`[RFC793 3.9] <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.9>`__.

You also need to handle the ``PACKET_ARRIVAL`` event in the following
handlers:

-  ``chitcpd_tcp_state_handle_FIN_WAIT_1``

-  ``chitcpd_tcp_state_handle_FIN_WAIT_2``

-  ``chitcpd_tcp_state_handle_CLOSE_WAIT``

-  ``chitcpd_tcp_state_handle_CLOSING``

-  ``chitcpd_tcp_state_handle_LAST_ACK``

-  Modify the handling of this event in
   ``chitcpd_tcp_state_handle_ESTABLISHED`` to handle ``FIN``
   packets.

All of these are described in the ``SEGMENT ARRIVES`` portion of
`[RFC793 3.9] <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.9>`__.
