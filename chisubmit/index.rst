chisubmit
=========

chisubmit is a system for managing the submission and grading of programming
assignments through GitHub or using a GitLab server.

chisubmit is currently only being used internally at the University of Chicago's
Department of Computer Science, and we do not have any public-facing documentation
for it. We expect to post public documentation on chisubmit by the end of 2015.
At your own peril, you can check out the 
`chisubmit GitHub repo <http://github.com/uchicago-cs/chisubmit/>`__.
