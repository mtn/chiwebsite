chisubmit
=========

chisubmit is a system for managing the submission and grading of programming
assignments through GitHub or using a GitLab server.

chisubmit is currently only being used internally at the University of Chicago's
Department of Computer Science, and our instructions are mainly intended for our
students. We do not currently have instructions on how to set up a chisubmit server
from scratch but, if you want to run chisubmit at your scool, you can check out the 
`chisubmit GitHub repo <http://github.com/uchicago-cs/chisubmit/>`_ at your own peril.
